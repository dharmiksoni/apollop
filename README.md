# Hiring Project Demo

## Introduction
    I would like to first mentioned that the biggest problem i encontered during this project was to make demo using such varierty of tech stacks. It was refreshing experience while working on this project. 
    Implementation includes Registration for new user to register, Login to get logged in, and once user is logged in they will be redirected to Admin page where 
    they can play with some of the table features implemented like searching, delete, filter etc.
